## Introduction

This repository is designed to help you get started with data analysis and visualization using Python. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced data scientist, you'll find useful resources and examples to enhance your skills.

## Python Basics

Explore the fundamental concepts of Python programming. This section includes:
- Variables and Data Types
- Control Structures (if-else, loops)
- Functions and Modules
- Object-Oriented Programming

## NumPy

NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python. In this section, you'll learn about:
- Array Creation and Manipulation
